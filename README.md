# Netram App

**What does this app do?**  
  

Given the image of a (isolated) word in a natural scene (like billboards, banners), the app predicts the text in the image. This problem is formally stated as **Scene Text Recognition.**  
  

We do Scene Text Recognition for two languages, English and Malayalam, in this application.
